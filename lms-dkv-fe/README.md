This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

# DKV LMS - Full Stack Application

A robust, full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) custom-built for Digital Visual Communication (DKV) and Photography education. This platform streamlines course delivery, student tracking, and user management through a secure, role-based ecosystem.

## 🔗 Deployment & Demo Links
*   **Frontend Deployment:** [Front End DKV LMS](https://crack-fe-tommy-poernomo.vercel.app/)
*   **Backend Deployment:** [Insert your Railway/Render Link Here]
*   **Database ERD Diagram:** [Desain Database](https://dbdiagram.io/d/6a095de79f1f8ec47b30c153)

---

## 📝 Project Description

**DKV LMS** is a centralized educational platform designed to bridge the gap between creative instructors and students in Vocational High School. Built using a modern decoupled architecture (Next.js for Frontend and NestJS for Backend), the application provides a seamless, high-performance environment for managing design modules and photography tracking. 

The system implements strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** split into three distinct dashboards:
*   **Admin:** Full CRUD operations over Teacher accounts to maintain institutional data integrity.
*   **Teacher:** Complete autonomy to create, read, update, and delete course materials and monitor student enrollment.
*   **Student:** An interactive portal to browse available courses, self-enroll, and track learning progress in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Secure Authentication:** Secure login and registration powered by JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with robust password hashing using Bcrypt.
*   **Fail-Safe Request Handling:** Implements manual token decoding on the backend controller to bypass guard latencies and guarantee precise extraction of user credentials.
*   **Full CRUD Multi-Dashboard:** Comprehensive data manipulation capabilities tailored specifically for each user role (Admin manages Teachers, Teachers manage Courses, Students manage Enrollments).
*   **Optimized Database Architecture:** Built on top of PostgreSQL (Supabase) using Prisma ORM with explicit session-based connections (`Direct URL` via Port 5432) to guarantee zero-downtime schema migrations.
*   **Interactive UI/UX:** Designed with a modern, dark-themed responsive interface using Tailwind CSS, complete with programmatic loading states (`isSubmitting`, `isEditing`, `isSaving`) to prevent duplicate form submissions and enhance user experience.

## 💡 Demo Guide for Team Lead Evaluation

When demonstrating this platform to the RevoU Team Lead, follow this exact workflow to showcase the robust Full-CRUD functionality:

1.  **Public Layer:** Visit `http://localhost:3001/` to verify the public catalog successfully fetches live courses from the database without requiring authentication.
2.  **Admin Flow:** Log in as Admin -> Create a new Teacher account -> Edit the Teacher's title -> Verify the live updates on the data table.
3.  **Teacher Flow:** Log in using the newly created Teacher credentials -> Create a new DKV/Photography course topic -> Modify the description.
4.  **Student Flow:** Log in as Student -> Browse the catalog -> Click "Ikuti Kelas" -> Click "Selesai Belajar" -> Verify the status instantly transforms into a permanent "Selesai" badge.
